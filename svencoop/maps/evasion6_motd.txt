THE EVASION
===========
Version 1

by Thobias "Forsete" Fast

Playing as Adrian Shephard set shortly after the nuclear bomb that devastated the Black Mesa Research Facility.
You find yourself on a Xen “island” being kept out of harms way.
Fortunately, you have managed to contact a scientist back on Earth and he can help you return.
Whether that’s a good thing only time will tell!
