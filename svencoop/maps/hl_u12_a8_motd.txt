Uplinked Page

Half-Life, Uplink, and more.

Uplinked is a series of eleven maps (SC 14 + hl_c12 vote) that aims to be an extension to "Forget About Freeman!".
Uplinked takes place between the original maps,
hence it can be started from "Forget About Freeman!" or "Black Mesa Inbound" like the original game.
The general premise is the same as the Half-Life demo, Uplink
(tune the transmitter to gain access to Lambda Complex).
Locations vary from Uplink or Half-Life Alpha inspired to completely original ones.
Be aware that Uplinked has more puzzles compared to the original game,
therefore might require more thinking.

My main goal in creation of Uplinked was to offer a unique gameplay...
experience while creating a chapter that is like it was part of the original game.
