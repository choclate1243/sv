Hangar16 presents "INTOLERABLE THREAT"
__________________________________________

As Gordon Freeman, you must face down the Administrator for the last time.
The Administrator has taken control of "HANGAR 16" a government command and control
facility in the desert. From here he is possibly planning a coup against
the government of the United States, and vengeance against those who have opposed
him in the past. You need to meet with an agent who has the access codes to
enter the heavily guarded base, infiltrate it and prepare the way for friendly
forces to attack.
