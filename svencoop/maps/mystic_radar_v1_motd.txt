Deception Island, Antarctica

You are couple of engineers of Ice measurement station on south of the island,
also being hardcore explorers of large amount of abandoned buildings and villages
there. once at night you discovered some abandoned station with large radar antennae.
The station was inaccessible though you had flashlights.

At cold and misty daytime your team
decided to try explore it again and managed to enter through rusty door to some garage room.
But suddenly even the flashlights started to darken up at sight and everyone lose their
conciousness. Later you wake up and notice the door is gone, soon realized than its
different room somewhere deep inside the station with some rusty bed and shelves,
also your flashlights are gone somehow. All limbs seems like burning and movement
is noticeably hard but your group stands up and has a mystery to solve in largely
icemelt water and mold absorbed place.
