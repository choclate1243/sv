RageMap2018 - Part B

A different challenge awaits you behind each of the doors! Sometimes you need to use the RageCube from the center of the spawn to finish a certain section. 

If you lost the cube, the button in the spawn room starts a vote to respawn it.

RageMap is a collaborative map project by the following SC mappers:
