                                    The Basics
==============================================
1) Attack trees and boulders to collect resources
2) Press the Flashlight button (F by default) to open the Action Menu
3) Craft a Building Plan (F -> Craft -> Tools) to begin building a base
4) Collect resources faster by crafting a Hatchet and Pick Axe


                                 Building a Base
==============================================
- The first part you build must be a "Foundation"
- Upgrade parts with the "Hammer" tool to strengthen them
- To place items, press Reload (R by default) while holding the "Building Plan"
- Place Tool Cupboards to prevent others from building around your base
- Fuse parts with the Hammer tool if you run out of Build Points


                                Building Plan Controls
==============================================
Primary Fire = Build structure
Secondary Fire = Cycle to next structure
Tertiary Fire = Cycle to previous structure
Reload = Switch between "Item Placement mode" and "Construction mode"


                                  Hammer Controls
==============================================
Primary Fire = Repair
Secondary Fire = Upgrade
Tertiary Fire = Fuse/Separate
Reload = Rotate

                                   Chat Commands
==============================================
.mode = show current game mode
.version = show script version

Admin only:
.save = save structures
.load = load structures
.airdrop = spawn a plane to drop supplies
.apache = spawn an apache
.item [name] [amount] = give yourself an item (.item "metal door" 2)
.clean = remove orphaned items from the map
.nodes = toggle node spawns
.speed [speed] = change the speed of the day-night cycle


                                  Troubleshooting
==============================================
1) Actions are delayed, especially the action menu:
If your actions are delayed, then you got desynced from the server. Rejoin
the server to fix this. Disabling the minimap and the graphical crafting menu
can help prevent this.

2) Game crashes with "Fatal Error: Too many decal surfaces!":
Set "mp_decals 2" in console and restart the game to prevent this.

3) Server sometimes is extremely laggy for a while, but otherwise fine.
Monster AI will trigger this if it gets stuck behind something. Admins can say .lag
in chat to fix this.

4) Everyone has a high ping:
The server can't handle the map. Try the rust_mini map instead.
