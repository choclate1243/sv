
THE TOMB OF DEATH - PART 1
**************************


You are a team of mercenaries sent to investigate some mysterious disappearances of archeologists exploring an ancient tomb. Unfortunately soon after arriving, the entrance to the tomb has caved in, and the tomb entrance appears to be shut with no evidence of tampering.

It'll take a long time for a rescue team to clear the rubble, so you decide to investigate the tomb, you've just got to figure out how to open the damn front door. It is said that this tomb has many booby traps, so be careful.

PS: There have been various rumours of "unknown creatures" sighted this area, although it's just a silly story to scare explorers no doubt.
